My name's osx04. I'm a grade 12 student in Nova Scotia, Canada with a passion for creating software. I've been coding since I was 11 years old and fell in love with the freedom to create my own websites and software.

Next year, I will be pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Applied Computer Science at [Acadia University](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2861216463). I'm excited for what the future has in store and I can't wait to share what I build next.

In the meantime, here's some pictures of my cat (Hope!) üêà
